Hello! I am Anna Di Iulio, an exchange student from Italy. My major back home is called Software, Communications and Electronic Engineering, with a focus on Software Engineering. Here in the US I am a Computer Science major. My goal in life would be to become a Data Scientist. 
I am taking this class because I believe that learing about Usability Engineering is fundamental in order to create a product that your users will enjoy.
